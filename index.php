			<h1>My Name Is Lucas Laudick</h1>
			<p>I was actually born in Oklahoma city, but moved to Albuquerque a couple months later where I went to school through highschool. I then went to Durango, CO on a golf scholarship to Fort Lewis College where I met my wife. We just got married in Maui, HI on February 5, 2016! We have two dogs one of which is only 12 weeks old and can be a pain in our butt sometimes but we still love her, well....sorta. Some of the things I love to do would have to include golfing, snowboarding, hiking, and just hanging out with family and friends. </p>
