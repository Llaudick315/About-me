			<h1>My Name Is Lucas</h1>
			<p>I was actually born in Oklahoma city, but moved to Albuquerque a couple months later where I went to school through highschool. I then went to Durango, CO on a golf scholarship to Fort Lewis College where I met my wife. We just got married in Maui, HI on February 5, 2016!</p>
